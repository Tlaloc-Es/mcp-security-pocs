# MCP Security POCs üö®

Exploring the **security boundaries** of Anthropic's **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.
This repository hosts **POCs, experiments, and research** around prompt injection, context leaks, authentication, OPA policies, and other MCP edge cases. All experiments are **educational, safe, and performed in controlled environments**.
