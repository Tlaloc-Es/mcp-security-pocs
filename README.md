# MCP Security POCs üö®

Exploring the security boundaries of **Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.  
This repository hosts **POCs, experiments, and research** around prompt injection, leaks, authentication, OPA policies, and other MCP edge cases.  
All experiments are **educational and safe**, performed in controlled environments.
